FPGA talk plan

* FPGA — what is it
* Why FPGA
    * Fast
    * Easy to use
    * Parallel computing
* How is it used and why today it’s even more popular
* How does it work from the inside
    * Beads and string metaphor
* Fields where FPGA is more commonly used (partly because it’s just a common parts that are shared over the years):
    * network data I/O
    * graphics processing
    * microprocessors
* Steps of creating FPGA
    * Design
    * Implementation
    * Debugging (with simulators)
* Verilog & vhdl
    * Hardware Describing Language
* Nobody knows HDL but want to develop for FPGA
    * OpenCL
    * Python and FPGA
* Testing
* Why do you want to do it with Python
* PYNQ
* Getting started with PYNQ
    * What is PYNQ?
    * Example
* MyHDL
* Getting started withMyHDL
  * What is MyHDL?
  * Why MyHDL?

  * Test example
* Not only Python
